Specifically, the activities will be to: Collect field data across multiple habitats: rocky intertidal and sandy beaches habitats; Manipulate tabular and spatial data for standardized data formats, such as Darwin Core, while controlling for quality; Publish datasets to OBIS, using tools for sharing data; Train on data science tools (R, Rmarkdown, Github) to mine data, conduct discovery and analysis, and produce reproducible research documents with interactive visualizations onto the web. 1.3 Logistics August 6-10, 2018 (+2 days for travel) Venue, August 6: INPE Opening of AmeriGEOSS Week Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Brasil Venue, August 7-10: CEBIMar Centro de Biologia Marinha (CEBIMar) - Universidade de São Paulo Praia do Segredo - São Sebastião São Paulo, Brasil 1.4 Organizers Pole-to-Pole Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) of the Americas - P2P MBON Institute for Marine Remote Sensing (ImaRS), College of Marine Science, University of South Florida, St. Petersburg, Florida, USA Centro de Biologia Marinha (CEBIMar) &amp; Instituto de Biociências (IB) - Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil AmeriGEOSS - Group on Earth Observations Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) 1.5 Workshop rationale This workshop is a first step for the implementation of the P2P network. It addresses capacity building and science development for conservation and management of living resources, to sustain critical ecosystem services for communities in the region. The workshop participants will develop standard protocols for field data collection, data formatting and publishing, following international standards (e.g. Darwin Core - DwC). Efforts will also focus on data discovery and analysis using tools provided by the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and the GEO BON MBON. P2P incorporates the biodiversity priorities of various GEO initiatives, including Blue Planet and AmeriGEOSS, and coordinates with IOC/UNESCO (GOOS and OBIS), and other national and international groups to serve the broadest possible community. This network will help nations and regions to improve conservation planning and environmental impact mitigation, serve the scientific community, and satisfy commitments to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), Aichi Targets of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s). The P2P workshop: enhances coordination of data collection among nations; improves the collection of harmonized data, developing data standards and methodologies for data management and dissemination without compromising national concerns; integrates biodiversity information with physical and chemical data over time (status and trends); and generates products needed for informed management of the ocean. The workshop targets investigators and resource managers dedicated to studying and conserving biodiversity of invertebrates in two important coastal habitats: rocky shore intertidal zone and sandy beaches. This activity targets participants from all nations in the Americas, from pole to pole. 1.6 Instructors Enrique Montes (USF) - Project lead and workshop coordinator Eduardo Klein (OBIS) - Darwin Core (DwC) and OBIS tools Ben Best (Ecoquants) - Data visualization and analysis tools using R software Patricia Miloslavich (GOOS) - Protocols of the South American Research Group on Coastal Ecosystems (SARCE) and Essential Ocean/Biodiversity Variables (EOV/EBV) framework Emmett Duffy (MarineGEO) - Predation and fouling community development, exotic invasions and biodiversity - an experimental approach (PanAmex Experiment).
