Collect field data across multiple habitats: rocky intertidal and sandy beaches habitats (SARCE). Manipulate tabular and spatial data for standardized data formats, such as Darwin Core, while controlling for quality Populate datasets to OBIS, using tools for data discovery, analysis, and sharing Build species distribution models by correlating satellite derived environmental data with biological observations to predict across seascapes Learn how to use data science tools (R, Rmarkdown, Github) for producing reproducible research documents with interactive visualizations onto the web. 1.2 Agenda Table 1.1: Agenda Time Description Aug 6, day 1, Mon: AmeriGEOSS Week (INPE; São José dos Campos) 9 am - noon Opening of AmeriGEOSS Week at the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE; São José dos Campos) [Gutierrez, Montes] 2 pm Departure to the Centro de Biologia Marinha (CEBIMar) in São Sebastião 4 pm Arrival at CEBIMar (lodging TBD) 7 pm Group dinner (TBD) Aug 7, day 2, Tue: Field sampling of intertidal rocky shore invertebrates 7:30 - 8:30 am Breakfast (it’d be good have it at CEBIMar) 8:30 - 9 am Welcome and workshop briefing [Montes] 9 - 9:45 am Rocky Intertidal sampling protocol &amp; taxonomy of invertebrates [Miloslavich] 9:45 - 10 am Cross-referencing Essential Ocean Variables and Essential Biodiversity Variables frameworks 10 - noon Field sampling activity (TBD) [Marques] 12:30 - 2 pm Lunch Aug 7 afternoon: back at CEBIMar 2 - 2:30 pm How to register data collected in the field.
