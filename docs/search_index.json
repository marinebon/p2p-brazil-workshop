Specifically, the activities will be to: Collect field data across multiple habitats: rocky intertidal and sandy beaches habitats; Manipulate tabular and spatial data for standardized data formats, such as Darwin Core, while controlling for quality; Publish datasets to OBIS, using tools for sharing data; Train on data science tools (R, Rmarkdown, Github) to mine data, conduct discovery and analysis, and produce reproducible research documents with interactive visualizations onto the web. 1.3 Logistics August 6-10, 2018 (+2 days for travel) Venue, August 6: INPE Opening of AmeriGEOSS Week Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Brasil Venue, August 7-10: CEBIMar Centro de Biologia Marinha (CEBIMar) - Universidade de São Paulo Praia do Segredo - São Sebastião São Paulo, Brasil 1.4 Organizers Pole-to-Pole Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) of the Americas - P2P MBON Institute for Marine Remote Sensing (ImaRS), College of Marine Science, University of South Florida, St. Petersburg, Florida, USA Centro de Biologia Marinha (CEBIMar) &amp; Instituto de Biociências (IB) - Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil AmeriGEOSS - Group on Earth Observations Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) 1.5 Workshop rationale This workshop is a first step for the implementation of the P2P network. It addresses capacity building and science development for conservation and management of living resources, to sustain critical ecosystem services for communities in the region. The workshop participants will develop standard protocols for field data collection, data formatting and publishing, following international standards (e.g. Darwin Core - DwC). Efforts will also focus on data discovery and analysis using tools provided by the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and the GEO BON MBON. P2P incorporates the biodiversity priorities of various GEO initiatives, including Blue Planet and AmeriGEOSS, and coordinates with IOC/UNESCO (GOOS and OBIS), and other national and international groups to serve the broadest possible community. This network will help nations and regions to improve conservation planning and environmental impact mitigation, serve the scientific community, and satisfy commitments to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), Aichi Targets of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s). The P2P workshop: enhances coordination of data collection among nations; improves the collection of harmonized data, developing data standards and methodologies for data management and dissemination without compromising national concerns; integrates biodiversity information with physical and chemical data over time (status and trends); and generates products needed for informed management of the ocean. The workshop targets investigators and resource managers dedicated to studying and conserving biodiversity of invertebrates in two important coastal habitats: rocky shore intertidal zone and sandy beaches. This activity targets participants from all nations in the Americas, from pole to pole. 1.6 Instructors Enrique Montes (USF) - Project lead and workshop coordinator Eduardo Klein (OBIS) - Darwin Core (DwC) and OBIS tools Ben Best (Ecoquants) - Data visualization and analysis tools using R software Patricia Miloslavich (GOOS) - Protocols of the South American Research Group on Coastal Ecosystems (SARCE) and Essential Ocean/Biodiversity Variables (EOV/EBV) framework Emmett Duffy (MarineGEO) - Predation and fouling community development, exotic invasions and biodiversity - an experimental approach (PanAmex Experiment).

["git-github.html", "2 Git &amp; Github 2.1 Setup Github &amp; Git 2.2 Github Workflows 2.3 Create Repository p2p-demo 2.4 Create index.html 2.5 Create RStudio Project with Git Repository 2.6 Create index.Rmd in Rmarkdown 2.7 Exercise: Gil’s Israel Sites Dataset", " 2 Git &amp; Github This section is paired with: Data Wrangling in the R Tidyverse - Google Slides The two main tools you’ll learn about to start are: Git is a version control system that lets you track changes to files over time. These files can be any kind of file (eg doc, pdf, xls), but free text differences are most easily visible (eg txt, csv, md). You can rollback changes made by you, or others. This facilitates a playground for collaboration, without fear of experimentation (you can always rollback changes). Github is a website for storing your git versioned files remotely. It has many nice features to be able visualize differences between images, rendering &amp; diffing map data files, render text data files, and track changes in text. Steps: Create Github login Create project website with Github Pages Edit README.md in Markdown Create HTML website content with R Markdown 2.1 Setup Github &amp; Git Create Github account at http://github.com, if you don’t already have one. For username, I recommend all lower-case letters, short as you can. If you use an email ending in .edu, you can request free private repositories via GitHub Education discount. Configure git with global commands. Open up the Bash version of Git and type the following: # display your version of git git --version # replace USER with your Github user account git config –-global user.name USER # replace USER@SOMEWHERE.EDU with the email you used to register with Github git config –-global user.email USER@SOMEWHERE.EDU # list your config to confirm user.* variables set git config --list 2.2 Github Workflows The two most common workflow models for working Github repositories is based on your permissions: writable: Push &amp; Pull (simplest) read only: Fork &amp; Pull Request (extra steps) We will only go over the first writable mode. For more on the second mode, see Forking Projects · GitHub Guides. 2.2.1 Push &amp; Pull repo location initialize edit update github.com/OWNER/REPO create ~/github/REPO clone commit , push pull Note that OWNER could be either an individual USER or group ORGANIZATION, which has member USERs. 2.3 Create Repository p2p-demo Now you will create a Github repository for a project. Create a repository called my-project. Please be sure to tick the box to Initialize this repository with a README. Otherwise defaults are fine. Create a branch called gh-pages. Per pages.github.com, since this will be a project site only web files in the gh-pages branch will show up at http://USER.github.io/REPO. For a user (or organization) site, the REPO must be named USER.github.io (or ORG.github.io) and then the default master branch will contain the web files for the website http://USER.github.io (or http://ORG.github.io). See also User, Organization, and Project Pages - Github Help. Set the default branch to gh-pages, NOT the default master. Delete the branch master, which will not be used. 2.3.1 Edit README.md in Markdown Commit your first change by editing the README.md which is in markdown, simple syntax for conversion to HTML. Now update the contents of the README.md with the following, having a link and a numbered list: # p2p-demo Wrangling data with R. ## Introduction This repository demonstrates **software** and _formats_: 1. **Git** 1. **Github** 1. _Markdown_ 1. _Rmarkdown_ ## Conclusion ![](https://octodex.github.com/images/labtocat.png) Now click on the Preview changes to see the markdown rendered as HTML: Notice the syntax for: numbered list gets automatically sequenced: 1., 1. headers get rendered at multiple levels: #, ## link: [](http://...) image: ![](http://...) italics: _word_ bold: **word** See Mastering Markdown · GitHub Guides and add some more personalized content to the README of your own, like a bulleted list or blockquote. 2.4 Create index.html By default index.html is served up. Go ahead and create a new file named index.html with the following basic HTML: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;My First Heading&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; You’ll be prompted to clone this repository into a folder on your local machine. See GitHub Desktop User Guides for more. You could also do this from the Bash Shell for Git with the command git clone https://github.com/USER/REPO.git, replacing USER with your Github username and REPO with my_project. Or you can use the Github Desktop App menu File -&gt; Clone Repository… 2.5 Create RStudio Project with Git Repository Next, you will clone the repository onto your local machine using RStudio. I recommend creating it in a folder github under your user or Documents folder. Open RStudio and under the menu File -&gt; New Project… -&gt; Version Control -&gt; git and enter the URL with the .git extension (also available from the repository’s Clone button): If it all works correctly then you should see the files downloaded and showing up in the Files pane of RStudio. If RStudio is configured correctly to work with Git, then you should also see a Git pane. 2.6 Create index.Rmd in Rmarkdown Back in RStudio, let’s create a new Rmarkdown file, which allows us to weave markdown text with chunks of R code to be evaluated and output content like tables and plots. File -&gt; New File -&gt; Rmarkdown… -&gt; Document of output format HTML, OK. You can give it a Title of “My Project”. After you click OK, most importantly File -&gt; Save as index (which will get named with the filename extension index.Rmd). Some initial text is already provided for you. Let’s go ahead and “Knit HTML”. Notice how the markdown is rendered similar to as before + R code chunks are surrounded by 3 backticks and {r LABEL}. These are evaluated and return the output text in the case of summary(cars) and the output plot in the case of plot(pressure). Notice how the code plot(pressure) is not shown in the HTML output because of the R code chunk option echo=FALSE. Before we continue exploring Rmarkdown, visit the Git pane, check all modified (M) or untracked (?) files, click Commit, enter a message like “added index” and click the “Commit” button. Then Push (up green arrow) to push the locally committed changes on your lapto up to the Github repository online. This will update https://github.com/USER/p2p-demo, and now you can also see your project website with a default index.html viewable at http://USER.github.io/p2p-demo For more on Rmarkdown: rmarkdown cheatsheet.pdf rmarkdown.rstudio.com knitr in a knutshell - Karl Broman A more advanced topic worth mentioning is dealing merge conflicts 2.7 Exercise: Gil’s Israel Sites Dataset Gil Rilov shared the following dataset for us to play with: Israel sites fall 2015-16.xlsx Please download and open this dataset. Your task is to investigate this dataset and prepare it for submission to OBIS. 2.7.1 Task: Provide Excel cell ranges for how you would divide data into tables? For reading and wrangling data in R, please see cheat sheets and resources mentioned in: Data Wrangling in the R Tidyverse - Google Slides "],
